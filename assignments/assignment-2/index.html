                    <p>KraveBeauty was born out of an epiphany. In 2017, our founder, skincare aficionado and YouTube OG, Liah Yoo had exhausted herself (and her skin) looking for miracle products to solve her skin woes. She had been there, done that, and probably gotten a pimple from it. She sought advice from all the brands, experts, and know-how’s, so how come she didn’t have IG-worthy skin? That’s when the lightbulb went off: if she was overwhelmed, the rest of us were probably over the hill. We were so overloaded by new trends and miracle products that we cared more about skincare than our skin. Time to #PressReset.
