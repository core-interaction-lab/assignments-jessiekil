            This project was assigned from my Core 2: Interaction Studio's class at Parsons School of Design. Our main goal for this project was to find different online platforms to find out how we can create a narrative. My proposal was based on Spotify and the theme of language. I wanted a 'feature' that would allow the listeners to select a language of their choice. And Spotify would generate a playlist according to it. The reason why I chose Spotify as my main platform is because nowadays, more people are listening to music, but it seemed like the default language was English. I wanted this project to serve as an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of all languages and learn more about its musical culture.
