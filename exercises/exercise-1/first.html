            This project was assigned from my Core 2: Interaction Studio's class at Parsons School of Design. Our main goal for this project was to find different online platforms to find out how we can create a narrative. My proposal was based on<a class="spot" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>and the theme of language. I wanted a 'feature' that would allow the listeners to select a language of their choice, and where Spotify would generate a playlist according to it.
