            <p>By now, you know the drill: If something was hard when you are falling in love, it’s even harder during it. That goes for work-life balance, for parenting, and especially for finding the will to change out of your favorite sweatpants.
            </p>
            
            <p>But when it comes to dating long-distance, it’s not quite as clear-cut. If you were in a long-distance relationship before the pandemic began, you’re likely fairly practiced in sustaining it from afar, said Theresa DiDonato, an associate professor of psychology at Loyola University Maryland and an expert in romantic relationships. It’s the newer couplings — those created shortly before or since the start of the pandemic — that may be on more fragile ground.

            <p>When I told Howard that we should meet again in five years to see if we were meant to be together, I thought I was just being practical. My idea was less about romance than hedging our bets.I was only 18 then, a freshman at Cornell, and he was barely 21. We had dated since September and now it was spring. Soon we would be headed back to opposite coasts, he to San Francisco and me to suburban New Jersey. The impending separation was forcing us to re-evaluate. Our dorm-room conversation went something like this:
            </p>
          
            <p>Maybe, maybe not. In any case, most of my interactions with men, whether short or long-lasting, only strengthened my sense that Howard probably was The One and that I had be prudent to arrange our second chance.
            </p>
          
            <p>Nevertheless, a few days before that first Sunday in May, I flew home to the Jersey suburbs for a visit with my mother, planning to head into the city for the weekend. My sister had an apartment on the Upper West Side, and it would be nothing unusual for me to stay with her because I always did when I visited.
            </p>

            <p>Life is not always about happy or sad situations. It has its own moments of ups and downs. How to adjust to each situation and take it in stride will greatly affect the quality of life and relationship with other people. The perception of love as being devoid of any problem, trouble, and pain is thus a misconception. People feel more and more pain as they are not able to live in love in a relationship with other people. Our perception of love has to change. We have to live with all the problems that we face in unison, sort out our differences, and make changes in our lifestyle to bring a semblance of love and tolerance to our attitudes. We have to meet the need of the soul to develop spiritual love for other persons which goes beyond physical attraction.

            For years, I ended the story with: “I thought I was just being practical in giving us a second chance. It turned out to be a good plan.”
