            <p>By now, you know the drill: If something was hard when you are falling in love, it’s even harder during it. That goes for work-life balance, for parenting, and especially for finding the will to change out of your favorite sweatpants.
            </p>
            
            <p>But when it comes to dating long-distance, it’s not quite as clear-cut. If you were in a long-distance relationship before the pandemic began, you’re likely fairly practiced in sustaining it from afar, said Theresa DiDonato, an associate professor of psychology at Loyola University Maryland and an expert in romantic relationships. It’s the newer couplings — those created shortly before or since the start of the pandemic — that may be on more fragile ground.
            </p>
          
            <p>When I told Howard that we should meet again in five years to see if we were meant to be together, I thought I was just being practical. My idea was less about romance than hedging our bets.I was only 18 then, a freshman at Cornell, and he was barely 21. We had dated since September and now it was spring. Soon we would be headed back to opposite coasts, he to San Francisco and me to suburban New Jersey. The impending separation was forcing us to re-evaluate. Our dorm-room conversation went something like this:
            </p>
          
            <p>Maybe, maybe not. In any case, most of my interactions with men, whether short or long-lasting, only strengthened my sense that Howard probably was The One and that I had be prudent to arrange our second chance.
            </p>
          
            <p>Nevertheless, a few days before that first Sunday in May, I flew home to the Jersey suburbs for a visit with my mother, planning to head into the city for the weekend. My sister had an apartment on the Upper West Side, and it would be nothing unusual for me to stay with her because I always did when I visited.
            </p>

            <p>Life is not always about happy or sad situations. It has its own moments of ups and downs. How to adjust to each situation and take it in stride will greatly affect the quality of life and relationship with other people. The perception of love as being devoid of any problem, trouble, and pain is thus a misconception. People feel more and more pain as they are not able to live in love in a relationship with other people. Our perception of love has to change. We have to live with all the problems that we face in unison, sort out our differences, and make changes in our lifestyle to bring a semblance of love and tolerance to our attitudes. We have to meet the need of the soul to develop spiritual love for other persons which goes beyond physical attraction. 
            </p>

            <p>
            For years, I ended the story with: “I thought I was just being practical in giving us a second chance. It turned out to be a good plan.”
            </p>

          <section class="section" id="section-2">
            
              <p>Me: “I think finding The One is a matter of person, place, and time. What if we’re both the right person but this is the wrong place and time? We’d miss our chance and regret it.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Him: “So, are you saying we should stay together?”
              </p>
              <p>
                Me: “No. I don’t want to marry the first guy I’m serious about. I’m saying, let’s give ourselves a second chance. Let’s meet in five years. I’ll be 23, and you’ll be 26. We’ll see if we want to get back together.”
              </p>
              <p>Howard agreed. We settled on meeting at the New York Public Library, near the uptown lion, at 4 p.m. on the first Sunday in April, five years from that spring. We wrote our pledge on a dollar bill, tore it in half, and gave each other the half we’d written on.
              </p>
              <p>Meeting in a public place would minimize any unwanted intimacy if things felt awkward. Four o’clock made sense because we could start with a drink, and if things went well, we could proceed to dinner and go from there. If things weren’t going well, we could go our separate ways.
              </p>
              <p>The New York Public Library was a sentimental choice; as English majors, we had spent a lot of time around books. And it was an easy landmark to find, one that was likely to still exist in five years, unlike a restaurant or bar.
              </p>
              <p>I used that time well. I had relationships, flings, crushes. With a few of those men, I wondered, “Is he The One?” For various reasons, the answer was never “Yes.” Might it have been “Yes” if Howard and I didn’t have our date planned?
              </p>
              <p>A part of our agreement that didn’t make it onto the dollar bill was that we would tell no one, a rule I promptly forgot. At some point, I told my best friend. She thought the plan was creative (but felt bad for the guy I was seeing at the time). I also told my mother, which was a mistake.
              </p>
              <p>But my mother kept suggesting an alternative plan, arguing that it would be better to go into New York when my sister wasn’t working (as a restaurant employee, she was busiest on weekends).
              </p>
              <p>I believe that long-distance relationships can work and that there is another person in the world meant for me. I can honestly say that I feel like I have found my soul mate or someone else’s heart that beats to the same beat as my own. Having a successful long-distance relationship, or any relationship, you have to believe it can work, be dedicated to your partner, and love more than you ever thought you could love another being. Love is a strong affection for another person (Webster’s Dictionary), and long-distance relationships require affection from your significant other. Long-distance relationships may be difficult for some, and easier for others.

          <section class="section" id="section-3">
              <p>So Howard and I took back our half dollar bills, crossed out April, wrote May, and handed them back to each other.
              </p>
              <p>We had three and a half years before our meeting.
              </p>
              <p>And then we failed to break up. In fact, we stayed together that summer and through the whole next school year. It wasn’t until the next semester when he took a leave of absence and lived in Manhattan, that our relationship finally ended. (I started seeing someone else, he found out, and that was that.)
              </p>
              <p>At the five-year mark, I was living in Minneapolis. I was in a relationship that had been staggering along for months. As for Howard and me, we hadn’t spoken or communicated at all for a couple of years. I vaguely knew of his whereabouts from mutual friends, but this was before cellphones, the internet, and email, a bygone era where you could actually lose touch with people and not know how to contact them even if you wanted to.
              </p>
              <p>“No,” I said. “I have to go in this weekend. I’m meeting Howard on Sunday.”
              </p>
              <p>That stopped her. “I didn’t know you two were still in touch.”
              </p>
              <p>“We haven’t been,” I said. “But we agreed to meet on the first Sunday in May this year, so I have to be in the city.”
              </p>
              <p>“When did you make this agreement?”
              </p>
              <p>“Five years ago.” I said.
              </p>
              <p>“Oh my God! Five years ago? Are you out of your mind? Doesn’t he live in California? He’s not going to fly all the way to New York for this.”
              </p>
              <p>“Yes, he will. I’m sure he’ll be there.”
              </p>
              <p>While I was on the train into Manhattan, my mother called my sister and urged her to keep me from following through, fearing I’d be heartbroken when Howard didn’t show.
              </p>
              <p>When I arrived, my sister said, “You’re trying to live your life like a movie. Real-life doesn’t work like that. He’s not even going to remember, much less travel 3,000 miles. You’re setting yourself up for big disappointment.”
              </p>
              <p>I disagreed.
              </p>
              <p>Love is a love that not every person will experience. It is a type of love that is not there at the beginning but grows within the individual. When one finally finds the love they have been looking for, one can not imagine life with anybody else. Love is a connection between two souls that are captured with a feeling that is not only felt within the heart but within their body as well.

              <p>That’s what had happened to us.</p>
              <p>She had to work that afternoon and evening, so I was (quite happily) on my own for the walk from the Upper West Side to Midtown. A few minutes before 4 p.m., I found myself standing across the street from the library, scanning the small crowd in front, when suddenly I saw Howard heading toward the library’s steps.
              </p>
              <p>We saw each other, smiled, and waved. I crossed the street and we hugged in front of the lion (Fortitude, I learned later), then sat down on the steps and started talking.
              </p>
              <p>Our conversation lasted two days. Then Howard caught a plane back to California.
              <p>
              <p>It wasn’t immediately “happily ever after” for us. I had to extricate myself from the relationship with the other guy. Howard and I also had to figure out how we were going to live in the same city.
              </p>
              <p>That fall I moved to the Bay Area for a couple of months on a work assignment. A few months later, he moved to Minneapolis, where we stayed for two years before moving to New York. And, yes, once we were back east, we married.
              </p>
              <p>I still resisted calling our story romantic. Friends who had heard the story tended to exaggerate the details, saying things like, “And you didn’t see each other for 10 years?”
              </p>
              <p>Actually, it was a five-year plan. And it was only three years that we were fully out of touch.
              </p>
              <p>Or they’ll say: “And you always knew …”
              </p>
              <p>No, that was the whole point of the agreement. We didn’t always know. Even after the meeting, it took a while for us to move in together. When we moved to New York, we agreed we would have to see how things worked out with jobs before making any promises.
              </p>
              <p>What is true is how the story has helped sustain our relationship through times of trouble. I would have hated to end the story with, “Unfortunately, it didn’t work out.” With a story like that, of course, we had to stay together. A romantic past, we’ve discovered, can help keep you belted in place until you find equilibrium.
              </p>
              <p>Still, I insisted the story was about foresight and prudence, not romance. I only shared the story with people who wouldn’t think I was trying to live my life like a movie — who would know the story was about being smart in love, not starry-eyed
              </p>
              <p>“Well, the plan may have been practical,” a friend said recently. “But the fact that you both showed up: There’s the romance.”
              </p>
              <p>He was right. It was our complete faith in the other person — despite others’ cautions — that defined the romance. We showed up for each other.
              </p>
              <p>We now have been married for 35 years. Howard still shows up for me, and I show up for him. The torn dollar bill is in a frame on his dresser.
