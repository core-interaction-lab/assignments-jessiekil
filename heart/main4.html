                    <p>this was a project from my core 2: interaction studio class. the topic of this project was creating an interactive website with a topic of our choice. i choice the article from new york times, "let's meet again in 5 years." i was inspired to work on topics surrounding love, time, and distance. i based my project on heart beat rates and the correlation to the context.
