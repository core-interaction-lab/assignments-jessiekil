                    <p>For Interaction Studio class' second project, we were assigned to choose a text with a minimum of 2000 words. I chose a New York Times article that I saw back in 2021. This article is called, "Let's Meet Again in 5 Years." I chose this article because I am also in a long distance relationship and I was able to relate deeply. I wanted this project to serve as an opportunity to look at long distance in a more positive and 'interactive' way.  
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p>In order to this, I researched the correct color palettes, fonts, and interactive elements for me and the users. I created different mockups on Figma and led to this website. For this project, I wanted my main symbol to be a pumping heart. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I categorized my texts in 4 different stages: Resting, Maximum Target, Moderate Intensity, and High Intensity. I categorized the texts into these four categories, use a slider to move around the different stages of texts. While they are using the slider, I wanted the heart to pump according to the heartbeat stage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For instance, the category High Intensity, would be the fastest beating heart out of all the stages. Whereas, resting would be the slowest beating heart.</p>
