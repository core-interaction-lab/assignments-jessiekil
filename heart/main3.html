                    <p>I was born in South Korea, but raised in India and Brazil. Therefore, I can speak English, Korean, Portuguese, and a little bit of Spanish! I love acai bowls, as well as Korean, and India food. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am taking this class to expand my knowledge within the web world. I am learning another class called Interaction Lab, which helps me gain knowledge about coding, specifically HTML and CSS.</p>
